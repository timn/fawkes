; Sub-type: RETRY-SUBGOAL
; Perform: single goal, retry configurable number times
; Params:  (params max-tries <N>) for N a positive integer
; Succeed: if sub-goal succeeds within <N> tries
; Fail:    if sub-goal fails in the <N>th try
; Reject:  if sub-goal is rejected in the <N>th try
;
; A RETRY parent goal takes one and only one sub-goal. Once the RETRY goal
; has been expanded, the sub-goal is executed. If it sub-goal fails or is
; rejected, the RETRY goal re-selects the sub-goal. In total, the sub-goal
; is tried for up to N times with N being a positive configurable integer
; passed as the only max-tries parameter. If the last try fails, the RETRY
; goals fails, if the goal is rejected on the last try, the RETRY goal is
; rejected.
;
; Interactions:
; - User FORMULATES goal
; - User SELECTS goal
; Options:
;   1. User EXPANDS goal when SELECTED, consisting of:
;      * create the single sub-goal with parent ID equal the RETRY goal ID
;      * set RETRY goal mode to EXPANDED
;   2. User already creates sub-goal when FORMULATING the RETRY goal
;      * Automatic: switching mode from SELECTED to EXPANDED without action
;      (a sub-goal already exists when switching to SELECTED mode)
; - Automatic: if no sub-goal formulated -> FAIL
; - Automatic: if more than one sub-goal formulated -> FAIL
; - Automatic: COMMIT sub-goal
; - Automatic: DISPATCH committed sub-goal by SELECTING it
; - Automatic: one of the following outcomes for the EVALUATED sub-goal:
;   * if sub-goal rejected and num-tries < max-tries -> EXPANDED
;   * if sub-goal fails and num-tries < max-tries -> EXPANDED
;   * if sub-goal rejected and num-tries == max-tries -> FINISHED|REJECTED
;   * if sub-goal fails and num-tries == max-tries -> FINISHED|FAILED
;   -> Sub-goal is RETRACTED.
; User: EVALUATE goal
; User: RETRACT goal
