; Sub-type: TRY-ALL-OF-SUBGOALS
; Perform: one goal at a time, ordered by goal priority
; Succeed: if exactly one sub-goal succeeds
; Fail:    if all sub-goals fail or are rejected and at least one failed
; Reject:  if all sub-goals are rejected and none failed
;
; A TRY-ALL parent goal will order the goals by priority and then
; start performing them in order. For goals which are rejected or
; fail, the goal continues with the next goal. On the first
; successfully executed goal, stops execution and succeeds. If all
; sub-goals are rejected, rejects the parent goal. If all sub-goals
; fail, fails the parent goal.
;
; Interactions:
; - User FORMULATES goal
; - User SELECTS goal
; - User EXPANDS goal, consisting of:
;   * create goals with parent ID equal the TRY-ALL goal ID
;   * set TRY-ALL goal mode to EXPANDED
; - Automatic: if no sub-goal formulated -> FAIL
; - Automatic: if all sub-goals rejected -> REJECT
; - Automatic: if all sub-goals failed -> FAIL
; - Automatic: take highest FORMULATED sub-goal and COMMIT to
; - Automatic: DISPATCH committed sub-goal by SELECTING it
; - User: handle sub-goal expansion, commiting, dispatching
; - Automatic: one of the following outcomes for the sub-goal:
;   * REJECTED: mode EXPANDED (re-try with other sub-goal)
;   * FAILED: mode EXPANDED (retry with other sub-goal)
;   * COMPLETED: mode FINISHED, outcome COMPLETED
;   -> Sub-goal is RETRACTED.
; User: EVALUATE goal
; User: RETRACT goal
