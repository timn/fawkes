; Sub-type: RUN-ONE-OF-SUBGOALS
; Perform: one goal at a time, ordered by goal priority
; Succeed: if exactly one sub-goal succeeds
; Fail:    if exactly one sub-goal fails
; Reject:  if all sub-goals are rejected
;
; A RunOne parent goal will order the goals by priority and then start
; performing them in order. For goals which are rejected, the goal
; continues with the next goal. If any goal succeeds or fails, the
; parent succeeds or fails respectively.
;
; Interactions:
; - User FORMULATES goal
; - User SELECTS goal
; - User EXPANDS goal, consisting of:
;   * create goals with parent ID equal the RUN-ONE goal ID
;   * set RUN-ONE goal mode to EXPANDED
; - Automatic: if no sub-goal formulated -> FAIL
; - Automatic: if all sub-goals rejected -> REJECT
; - Automatic: take highest FORMULATED sub-goal and COMMIT to
; - Automatic: DISPATCH committed sub-goal by SELECTING it
; - User: handle sub-goal expansion, commiting, dispatching
; - Automatic: when sub-goal is EVALUATED, outcome determines parent goal:
;   * REJECTED: mode EXPANDED (re-try with other sub-goal)
;   * FAILED: mode FINISHED, outcome FAILED, message
;   * COMPLETED: mode FINISHED, outcome COMPLETED
;   -> Sub-goal is RETRACTED.
; User: EVALUATE goal
; User: RETRACT goal
